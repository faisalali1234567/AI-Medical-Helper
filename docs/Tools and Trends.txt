Tools and Trends

Tools Used
1. Hugging Face Embeddings
Purpose: Converts textual data (e.g., symptoms, diseases, medicines) into vector embeddings for machine-readable representation.
Model Used: all-MiniLM-L6-v2, a lightweight yet powerful embedding model.
Why Used: Offers fast, accurate, and resource-efficient embeddings, perfect for medical domain-specific data.
2. FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
Purpose: A vector database used for fast similarity searches across embeddings.
Why Used:
Handles high-dimensional data efficiently.
Performs rapid nearest-neighbor searches, even on large datasets.
Ensures scalability for real-time query retrieval.
3. Google PaLM (Gemini Pro)
Purpose: A state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) used for generating responses.
Why Used:
Specialized in conversational and instruction-following tasks.
Excels in understanding context and generating domain-specific responses.
Superior fine-tuning and medical terminology understanding compared to many general-purpose LLMs.
4. LangChain Framework
Purpose: Orchestrates the integration of embeddings, vector databases, and LLMs for seamless workflow.
Why Used: Simplifies the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation and allows for modular development.
5. Streamlit
Purpose: A Python-based framework for creating interactive web applications.
Why Used: Provides a lightweight, user-friendly interface to query the AI system.
6. Environment Management Tools
Python Libraries: dotenv (to manage environment variables securely).
Version Control: GitHub for code collaboration and repository management.
